# Bounce

This is a fun game that applies some basics physics in Pygame. This was coded without a physics engine, just using simple math.

You can use arrow keys to move or 'a' and 'd'. For users on mobile, click on the left side of the screen to move left and on the right to move right.

Hope you enjoy as always!
